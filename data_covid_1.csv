What’s the use of vaccine when everyone gets herd or individually immune to the disease way even before vaccine gets released in the market. Way great work without saving life now is a waste of time. And now u say “animal study results”. Admire you for great work but useless work,1

What you are doing is wrong. You have colluded with the India Nazi Govt and putting Indian lives in danger. How can you announce the dates of successful trails much earlier. i think BBL should be booked for cheating. #CheaterBharatBiotech. You cant help somebody for headlines,0
Did you buy it from the lab that released the virus? Was it China alone or US or joint venture? @BharatBiotech ,0

Here in India human lives are less important than animal! People lives are important in Russia that's why they are registered it on emergency basis. Covaxin and Sputnik V started human trials at the same time. But we are very late due to red tape. #peopleslivesmatter,1
